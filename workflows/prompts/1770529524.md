# Create a prompt engineering skill with library tracking

> This prompt was iterated on as we built the prompt skill itself — see [`.claude/skills/prompt/SKILL.md`](../../.claude/skills/prompt/SKILL.md) for the resulting artifact.

## Human Prompt

Create a skill called "prompt" that triggers on "make a prompt". It should:

- Take raw input and clean it up into a well-designed prompt without adding complexity
- Reformat and structure for quick scanning so the human can review
- Present review options: "Do it" to proceed, "What did I say?" to re-display the cleaned prompt
- Never execute without explicit "Do it"
- Never repeat or summarize what was just done — stay in conversation flow
- On "Do it": iterate on the prompt one more time using conversation context, warn if changes indicate architectural hacks or workarounds
- Execute via Task tool subagent (general-purpose) for fresh context, summarize progress concisely back to main conversation
- Save prompt files to workflows/prompts/ with unix timestamp filenames
- Files indexed by: author, project, tags, conversation_id, commit_hash, status
- Include Human Prompt, Agent Prompt, and Result sections
- Result filled at commit time
- CLAUDE.md rule: every commit updates corresponding prompt files
- Prompt design philosophy: architecture over code, first principles, robustness, no unnecessary complexity

## Agent Prompt

Created the prompt skill at `.claude/skills/prompt/SKILL.md` with a Critical Rules section enforcing: no execution without "Do it", no recaps, stay in flow. Workflow: clean & structure → review via AskUserQuestion (Do it / What did I say?) → iterate & warn → execute via subagent → save prompt file. Created `workflows/prompts/` directory and `CLAUDE.md` with commit rules for prompt file maintenance.

## Result

Delivered as designed. Created three artifacts:
- `.claude/skills/prompt/SKILL.md` — the skill with critical rules, 5-step workflow, prompt file format, and indexing scheme
- `workflows/prompts/` — prompt library directory with this file as first entry
- `CLAUDE.md` — commit rules linking code changes to prompt files

Iterated through multiple revisions based on live feedback: added "What did I say?" option, enforced "Do it" gate, added no-recap rule, switched from generic to project-specific subagent execution model. The skill design was dogfooded during its own creation.
