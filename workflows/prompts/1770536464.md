# Create initial commit and PR for Slate v0

## Human Prompt

I'm ready to make the initial commit for Slate. This has a lot of stuff in it. I want to:

- Understand how we've been documenting things (check workflows/prompts/ and workflows/meta/)
- Review all changes to understand what was done
- Create a concise, information-dense commit message
- Create a PR description that is high ROI for humans — points to locations for more info, uses diagrams where helpful
- Suggest key inline PR comments for important decisions/changes
- This should become a repeatable workflow for creating PRs

The PR description should help humans get familiar with the repo structure and key decisions without being overly verbose. We iterate quickly so density > length.

Additional context: project isn't initialized yet, so create the repo with an empty initial commit first, then make the setup code into a PR.

## Agent Prompt

Reviewed all workflows/meta/ entries and prompts to understand documentation patterns. Analyzed all 38 staged files. Created git repo with empty initial commit on master, feature branch with all v0 code, and PR with architecture diagram, key decisions table, and reading order for new developers.

## Result

Delivered. PR #1 at https://github.com/damsac/slate/pull/1. Also cleaned up setup skill placeholder files, added build artifact patterns to .gitignore, and renamed default branch from main to master per developer preference.
