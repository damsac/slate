# 000: Onboarding — <your-name>

## How to use this

Copy this file to `workflows/meta/<your-github-username>/000-onboarding.md` and fill it in as you get up to speed. This is your developer journal for Slate.

Each author maintains their own numbered sequence:
```
workflows/meta/
  gudnuf/          # original developer
    000-research-and-ideation.md
    001-initial-build.md
  <you>/
    000-onboarding.md
    001-first-feature.md
```

### What goes in a meta entry

- Developer thinking and decision rationale (the "why")
- Problems encountered and how they were solved
- Links to conversation sessions and prompt files
- Architecture snapshots when things change

### Cadence

Every non-trivial PR gets a new meta entry. Small fixes don't need one.

### Linking to prompts

Meta entries reference `workflows/prompts/<timestamp>.md` files. Prompts contain implementation details; meta entries contain the narrative.

## Context

Start by reading:
1. [gudnuf/000-research-and-ideation.md](gudnuf/000-research-and-ideation.md) — why this app exists, tech stack decisions
2. [gudnuf/001-initial-build.md](gudnuf/001-initial-build.md) — how the v0 was built

Then run `/setup` to get your environment working.
